# Tessellated Security
Tessellated Security is an end-to-end service to take your own tessel 2 and a magnetic switch and build your own security system. 

For the DYI security afficionado, all inclusive code to run a server (Node/Express), webclient, database (MongoDB/Mongoose), and a [tessel](https://tessel.io/) hooked up to a [magnetic door switch](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13247). A detailed spec sheet of all of the parts used is below along with detailed instructions on how to put what where.  The project's server running here is hosted on Heroku while the database is on mLab. Below is an explanation about setting up your own tessel.
